## Introduction

Why are we talking about SQL?

Most applications need a [data store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_store)
to persist important information. A relational database is the most common
datastore for a web application. SQL is the language of relational databases.

At it's simplest, a relational database is a mechanism to store and retrieve
data in a tabular form.
